# 📊 Customer Review Insight AI

## 📌 Overview
In today’s digital era, customer reviews are a goldmine of feedback, but the sheer volume makes it difficult to extract meaningful insights manually. Traditional sentiment analysis only provides an overall positive or negative score, failing to capture **which aspects** (e.g., battery life, camera, service quality) customers actually like or dislike.  

**Customer Review Insight AI** solves this by using **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** with Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system identifies product/service aspects from reviews and analyzes their associated sentiment, enabling businesses to make **data-driven decisions** that improve products, services, and customer satisfaction.

- **Trend Tracking** – Monitor sentiment trends over time.  
- **Scalable & Flexible** – Works across industries like electronics, hospitality, and entertainment.  
- **Interactive Visualization** – User-friendly dashboards for insights.  
- **Admin Dashboard** – Manage categories, monitor system performance, and review analysis quality.
